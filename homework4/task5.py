This task is optional.
Write a generator that takes a number N as an input
and returns a generator that yields N FizzBuzz numbers*
Don't use any ifs, you can find an approach for the implementation in this video**.
Definition of done:
 - function is created
 - function is properly formatted
 - function has tests
# >>> list(fizzbuzz(5))
